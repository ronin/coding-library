# Coding Library

This is a collection of some script, algorithms and programs that I've
implemented during my career as a developer. I've found it on some archive disk
so I thought it maybe useful for somebody or just fun to see it.

Note that some of those programs need to be compiled using legacy compilers or
require legacy operating system. They may also not work properly. I will try to
update instructions on how to run them.

I'll add more stuff later on.
